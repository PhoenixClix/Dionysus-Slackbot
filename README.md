# TESTING THE BOT

- clone the repo and CD into slackbot
- run `npm install` to install npm packages
- run `npm test` on the terminal to see a return json conversation history

**If you want to test this bot locally on your own slack workspace make sure to change the SLACK_BOT_AUTH and SLACK_USER_AUTH codes respectively and also update the CHANNEL ID** 

The dionysus both should work
